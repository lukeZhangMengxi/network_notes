### What is a layer
"A layer, in this context, corresponds strongly to the idea
of a **programming interface or library**, with the understanding
that a given layer communicates directly only
with the two layers immediately above and below it."

### The 4 layers
1. Application
2. Transport
    - Send user data
3. IP (Internet Protocol)
    - Provide abstraction for connecting multiple LANs into the Internet
    - Device forward information on this layer is called **router**
4. LAN (Local Area Network)
    - "Physical" network that provides connections between machines in a small area, like home, school, or corporation
    - Actual delivery of packets
    - Device forward information on this layer is called **switch**
    1. Logical LAN
    2. Physical LAN
